package semaphores;

/**
 * <p>
 * Semaphores are mainly used to limit the number of simultaneous threads that
 * can access a resources, but you can also use them to implement deadlock
 * recovery systems since a semaphore with one permit is basically a lock that
 * you can unlock from other threads. In this video we'll take a look at the
 * most important methods of the Semaphore class, and I'll also show you an
 * example of limiting the number of "connections" that threads can make
 * simultaneously.
